Evangelion skin for rainmeter

Place @Vault and Nerv folders into your skin directory. By default it should be \Documents\Rainmeter\Skins. For the monitoring portions to work you must download and install HWinfo64 and turn on shared memory. GPU information should work out of the box for everyone, but it is configured for my Sapphire 7900xtx Nitro+. Nvidia users may need to tweak the HWiNFOgpu.inc file.

If temperature values are showing as zero you may need to install the Rainmeter plugin for HWinfo. I have added the 3.2 version to this repo.
